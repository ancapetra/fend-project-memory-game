## About

The memory game was built as a Udacity Course project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose is to build performance.

## Instructions

### How to Load the Game

**Clone** the **[repo](https://github.com/ancapetra/fend-project-memory-game.git)** and open *index.html*.

### How to Play the Game

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.
On each turn:

   - The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
   - The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
   - If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
   - If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state.
   - The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
   - A message is displayed with your position in leaderboard.
   - At the end you have the option to play again.

If you spent too much time on one match you can always restart the game from the *Restart Game* button (**&circlearrowright;**) or using the **R** key on the keyboard.

This is a forked version of the Udacity Course project with my improvements according to the **[Project Rubic](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/591/view)**.
